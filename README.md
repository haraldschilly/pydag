# pyDAG

This Python library reads [COOCNUT DAG](http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/glopt/coconut/) files,
and converts them to [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) data structures,
and wraps them in a `DAG` class for convenience and interoperability.

## Status

It's currently in development and only supports a small subset
of the instructions (but these are the important ones!).

## License

Apache 2.0

*Note*: Copyright of the example DAG files belongs to the COCONUT Project.
